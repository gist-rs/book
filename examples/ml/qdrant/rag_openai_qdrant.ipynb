        "\n",
        "In the ever-evolving landscape of AI, the consistency and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a challenge. While these models can understand statistical relationships between words, they often fail to provide accurate factual responses. Because their internal knowledge may not be accurate, outputs can range from spot-on to nonsensical. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework designed to bolster the accuracy of LLMs by grounding them in external knowledge bases. In this example, we'll demonstrate a streamlined  implementation of the RAG pipeline using only Qdrant and OpenAI SDKs. By harnessing Flag embedding's power, we can bypass additional frameworks' overhead.\n",

NGINX as a reverse proxy: NGINX can be used as a reverse proxy server to handle incoming requests and distribute them to multiple instances of the FastAPI application running on different machines or containers. NGINX can also handle load balancing, caching, and SSL termination.\\n\\n2. FastAPI: FastAPI is the web framework for building the API itself. It provides an efficient, high-performance way to handle HTTP requests and responses based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI supports async operations, automatic validation of request data, automatic generation of documentation, and more.\\n\\n3. Qdrant: Qdrant can be used as a vector database and vector similarity search engine to power certain search functionalities of the web API. It can be integrated into the FastAPI application as a separate service or module. Qdrant allows for searching high-dimensional vectors and can be useful for applications that require matching, searching, recommending, and more based on vector data.\\n\\nThis stack can enable the development of a high-performance web API with rich features, scalability, and efficient handling of requests. \\n\\nPlease note that there are several other components that can be part of a web API stack depending on the specific requirements of the application, such as databases, caching layers, message queues, etc. This answer presents a possible stack based on the given context.'"
