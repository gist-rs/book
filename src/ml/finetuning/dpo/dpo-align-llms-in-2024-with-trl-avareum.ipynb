    "# RLHF in 2024 with DPO & Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post walks you through how to use DPO to improve open LLMs using Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) in 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research and experiments suggest that DPO should only be applied after SFT. This means we need an already fine-tuned LLM, which can be aligned with DPO. In this example we will use [cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b) a fine-tuned Mistral 7B with ChatML template. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup development environment\n",
    "2. Create and prepare the preference dataset\n",
    "3. Align LLM with TRL and the DPOTrainer\n",
    "4. Test LLM (vibe-check)\n",
    "5. Evaluate open LLMs on MT-Bench\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This example is designed to be an introduction to DPO and TRL. It is build for a single GPU environment to guide you through the process. For production use, you should consider using a distributed environment. It should be possible to run the example on a single GPU with at least 24GB of memory by reducing the training arguments, with batch size, max seq length and run evaluation after the training._"

    "Our first step is to install Hugging Face Libraries and Pytorch, including trl, transformers and datasets. If you haven't heard of trl yet, don't worry. It is a new library on top of transformers and datasets, which makes it easier to fine-tune, rlhf, align open LLMs."

    "Improving the helpfulness or quality of LLMs through Aligning methods like DPO doesn’t come for free. Compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alignment methods require preference data. Preference data is crucial as it serves as a proxy against which the model's outputs are evaluated and aligned. A typical DPO dataset includes a triplet out of prompt, chosen, and rejected response. There are several ways to create such a dataset, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using existing open-source datasets, e.g., [SHP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/SHP)\n",
    "- Using LLMs to create synthetic preferences, e.g., [Ultrafeedback](https://www.notion.so/9de9ac96f0f94aa5aed96361a26e8bf0?pvs=21)\n",
    "- Using Humans to create datasets, e.g., [HH](https://www.notion.so/SageMaker-bi-weekly-sync-0be2e6ba876a4599b4c0da2681dfb78f?pvs=21)\n",
    "- Using a combination of the above methods, e.g., [Orca DPO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Intel/orca_dpo_pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has advantages and disadvantages and depends on the budget, time, and quality requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "*It's important to recognize that preference datasets can inherently reflect the biases of the human/AI they are based on. To ensure broader applicability and fairness, it's crucial to incorporate a diverse range of feedback in creating these datasets.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we will use the [argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned?row=0) dataset. The best DPO dataset represents the real-world preferences of your users or customers. If you don’t have collected preferences yet, start with your existing SFT data and use different sizes/quality LLMs to generate feedback. This method was used to create the Orca DPO dataset, where GPT-4 was used for the accepted responses and Llama 70B Chat for the rejected responses. A DPO dataset will have the following format\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"chosen\": \"<prompt + good response>\", \"rejected\": \"<prompt + worse response>\" }\n",
    "{\"chosen\": \"<prompt + good response>\", \"rejected\": \"<prompt + worse response>\" }\n",
    "{\"chosen\": \"<prompt + good response>\", \"rejected\": \"<prompt + worse response>\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<pompt + good response>` and `<prompt + worse response>` are representend in the `conversational` format as: \n",

    "```json\n",
    "[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are...\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"...\"}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note:** If the dataset includes multiple turns you need to make sure that only the last turn between chosen and rejected is different. If not, you must reduce the conversation until only the last assistant turn is different._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPOTrainer expects the inputs as triples of (prompt, chosen, rejected), where `chosen` and `rejected` are the final turn of a dialogue and the `prompt` is N-1 turns. Those inputs also need to be already formated with the tempalte of the model, e.g. `<|im_start|>user\\nINSTRUCTION\\n<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we are going to load our open-source dataset using the 🤗 Datasets library and then convert it into the correct format. The  [argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned?row=0) already comes with the DPO format (chosen/rejected). This means we can create our triplet and templetite it usng a `tokenizer` and the `apply_chat_template` methoh. We are randomly downsampling the dataset to 11,000 training samples and 2,750 test samples\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This step can be different for your use case. For example, if you might need to create the `conversational` format and concate the prompt and chosen/rejected response, e.g. `Human:\\n ... Assistant:\\n`._\n",

    "One big difference to SFT is that for DPO we need an additional Reference Model, which is used for KL-Divergence to help stabilize the training. The Reference Model is normally the same model as the one we are training, but frozen. This means for DPO you need additional memory and compute resources. To keep our example efficient we will use PEFT and adatpers. We load your fine-tuned and then add a new trainable adapters. This means that we will only tune adapters and not the whole model using DPO. The origian model will be then used as reference model itself. If you want to train all parameter with DPO you need to provide a `model` and `reference_model, but this requires more memory and compute resources.\n",
