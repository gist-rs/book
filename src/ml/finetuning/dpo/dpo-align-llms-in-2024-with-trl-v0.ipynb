    "# RLHF in 2024 with DPO & Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post walks you through how to use DPO to improve open LLMs using Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) in 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research and experiments suggest that DPO should only be applied after SFT. This means we need an already fine-tuned LLM, which can be aligned with DPO. In this example we will use [cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.1-mistral-7b) a fine-tuned Mistral 7B with ChatML template. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup development environment\n",
    "2. Create and prepare the preference dataset\n",
    "3. Align LLM with TRL and the DPOTrainer\n",
    "4. Test LLM (vibe-check)\n",
    "5. Evaluate open LLMs on MT-Bench\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This example is designed to be an introduction to DPO and TRL. It is build for a single GPU environment to guide you through the process. For production use, you should consider using a distributed environment. It should be possible to run the example on a single GPU with at least 24GB of memory by reducing the training arguments, with batch size, max seq length and run evaluation after the training._\n"

    "\n",
    "Improving the helpfulness or quality of LLMs through Aligning methods like DPO doesn’t come for free. Compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alignment methods require preference data. Preference data is crucial as it serves as a proxy against which the model's outputs are evaluated and aligned. A typical DPO dataset includes a triplet out of prompt, chosen, and rejected response. There are several ways to create such a dataset, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using existing open-source datasets, e.g., [SHP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/SHP)\n",
    "- Using LLMs to create synthetic preferences, e.g., [Ultrafeedback](https://www.notion.so/9de9ac96f0f94aa5aed96361a26e8bf0?pvs=21)\n",
    "- Using Humans to create datasets, e.g., [HH](https://www.notion.so/SageMaker-bi-weekly-sync-0be2e6ba876a4599b4c0da2681dfb78f?pvs=21)\n",
    "- Using a combination of the above methods, e.g., [Orca DPO](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Intel/orca_dpo_pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has advantages and disadvantages and depends on the budget, time, and quality requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "*It's important to recognize that preference datasets can inherently reflect the biases of the human/AI they are based on. To ensure broader applicability and fairness, it's crucial to incorporate a diverse range of feedback in creating these datasets.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we will use the [argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned?row=0) dataset. The best DPO dataset represents the real-world preferences of your users or customers. If you don’t have collected preferences yet, start with your existing SFT data and use different sizes/quality LLMs to generate feedback. This method was used to create the Orca DPO dataset, where GPT-4 was used for the accepted responses and Llama 70B Chat for the rejected responses. A DPO dataset will have the following format\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"chosen\": \"<prompt + good response>\", \"rejected\": \"<prompt + worse response>\" }\n",
    "{\"chosen\": \"<prompt + good response>\", \"rejected\": \"<prompt + worse response>\" }\n",
    "{\"chosen\": \"<prompt + good response>\", \"rejected\": \"<prompt + worse response>\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<pompt + good response>` and `<prompt + worse response>` are representend in the `conversational` format as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are...\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"...\"}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note:** If the dataset includes multiple turns you need to make sure that only the last turn between chosen and rejected is different. If not, you must reduce the conversation until only the last assistant turn is different._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPOTrainer expects the inputs as triples of (prompt, chosen, rejected), where `chosen` and `rejected` are the final turn of a dialogue and the `prompt` is N-1 turns. Those inputs also need to be already formated with the tempalte of the model, e.g. `<|im_start|>user\\nINSTRUCTION\\n<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we are going to load our open-source dataset using the 🤗 Datasets library and then convert it into the correct format. The  [argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/ultrafeedback-binarized-preferences-cleaned?row=0) already comes with the DPO format (chosen/rejected). This means we can create our triplet and templetite it usng a `tokenizer` and the `apply_chat_template` methoh. We are randomly downsampling the dataset to 11,000 training samples and 2,750 test samples\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: This step can be different for your use case. For example, if you might need to create the `conversational` format and concate the prompt and chosen/rejected response, e.g. `Human:\\n ... Assistant:\\n`._\n",

The Reference Model is normally the same model as the one we are training, but frozen. This means for DPO you need additional memory and compute resources. To keep our example efficient we will use PEFT and adatpers. We load your fine-tuned and then add a new trainable adapters. This means that we will only tune adapters and not the whole model using DPO. The origian model will be then used as reference model itself.

It's Bengay, a topical medication that contains three active ingredients: methyl salicylate, menthol, and camphor. Methyl salicylate is derived from wintergreen oil, and has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, which means it can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Menthol, also found in peppermint oil, can also provide pain relief and works by creating a cooling sensation when applied to the skin. Camphor is another ingredient that can help to soothe sore muscles and joints. This compound can also create a cooling sensation when applied to the skin, which can help to reduce inflammation and provide relief from pain.\n",

      "How can i get rid of llamas in my backyard?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Generated Answer**:\n",
      "To keep llamas off your property, try the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Fence your property. Llamas are quite tall, so you’ll need a tall, sturdy fence to keep them out. Wire mesh is a good choice, as it can’t be chewed through easily.\n",
      "2. Use motion sensors. Installing motion sensors can scare off llamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why are llamas aggressive?\n",
      "\n",
      "Llamas are sometimes perceived as aggressive because they can be quite protective of their territory and their herd. This is a natural instinct that helps them survive in the wild. However, it’s important to remember that llamas can also be very gentle and affectionate animals when they feel safe and secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How do you calm a scared llama?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a scared llama, there are several things you can do to help calm them down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Speak in a soothing voice: Llamas can pick up on human emotions, so speaking calmly and gently can help to reassure them.\n",
      "2. Offer food: Llamas love food, and offering them a treat can help to distract them and make them feel more secure.\n",
      "3. Give them space: If the llama is frightened, they may need some time and space to calm down. Allowing them to retreat to a quiet area can help them to feel more secure.\n",
      "4. Use positive reinforcement: If you need to approach or handle a scared llama, it’s important to do so gently and calmly. Using positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise, can help to build trust and make them more comfortable around you.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How do you protect your house from wild animals?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several ways you can protect your house from wild animals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Install a fence: A tall, sturdy fence can help to keep wild animals out of your yard. Wire mesh is a good choice, as it can’t be chewed through easily.\n",
      "2. Use motion sensors: Installing motion sensors can scare off wild animals.\n",
      "3. Keep your yard clean: Removing food sources, such as garbage cans and compost piles, can help to deter wild animals from your property.\n",
      "4. Trim trees and shrubs: Overgrown trees and shrubs can provide cover for wild animals. Trimming them back can help to make your yard less inviting.\n",
      "5. Seal any gaps or openings: Sealing any gaps or openings in your home can help to prevent wild animals from getting inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Do llamas protect your house?\n",
      "\n",
      "Llamas are often kept as guard animals for livestock, as they are protective of their territory and herd. However, it’s not common for llamas to be kept specifically to protect a house. While they may help to deter wild animals from your property, they can also be quite territorial and may not get along with other pets or animals you have on your property.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Llamas can be a nuisance if they’re getting into your yard and causing problems. If you want to get rid of them, try some of the methods listed above, such as installing a fence, using motion sensors, or contacting a local wildlife control agency. Remember that llamas are protected animals, so it’s important to handle the situation in a humane way.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with any wild animal, it’s also important to take precautions to protect your home and yard from damage and to keep yourself and your family safe. This may involve sealing gaps in your home, trimming trees and shrubs, and keeping your yard clean and free of food sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, it may be necessary to contact a professional wildlife control agency to help you deal with a llama problem. These agencies can help to safely remove the llamas from your property and relocate them to a more appropriate environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while llamas can be a nuisance, they are generally gentle animals that can be safely managed with a little patience and understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "For our use case we will use [MT-Bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/llm_judge/README.md). MT-Bench is a Benchmark designed by LMSYS to test the conversation and instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It evaluates LLMs through multi-turn conversations, focusing on their ability to engage in coherent, informative, and engaging exchanges. Since human evaluation is very expensive and time consuming, LMSYS uses GPT-4-Turbo to grade the model responses. Their paper shows as 80% agreement between strong LLM and human preferences. The [LMSYS leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) is updated regularly (last updated February 2, 2024). MT-Bench is part of the [FastChat Repository](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/llm_judge/README.md). \n",

    "2. Generate Responses using our SFT (original) & DPO (trained) model\n",
    "3. Evaluate the responses using pair-wise comparison and GPT-4-Turbo as Judge\n",
    "4. Plot and compare the results\n",
