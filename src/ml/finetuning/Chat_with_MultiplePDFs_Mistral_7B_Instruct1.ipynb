Basics of Rust Concurrency\\nLong before multi-core processors were commonplace, operating systems allowed for a\\nsingle computer to run many programs concurrently . This is achieved by rapidly switching\\nbetween processes, allowing each to repeatedly make a little bit of progress, one by one.\\nNowadays, virtuall y all our computer s and even our phones and watches have processors\\nwith multiple cores, which can truly execute multiple processes in parallel .\\nOperating systems isolate processes from each other as much as possible, allowing a pro‐\\ngram to do its thing while completely unaware of what any other processes are doing. For\\nexample, a process cannot normally access the memory of another process, or communi ‐\\ncate with it in any way , without asking the operating system’ s kernel ﬁrst.\\nHowever , a program can spawn extra threads of executi on, as part of the same process .\\nThreads within the same process are not isolated from each other . Threads share memory\\nand can interact with each other through that memory .\\nThis chapter will explain how threads are spawned in Rust, and all the basic concepts\\naround them, such as how to safely share data between multiple threads. The concepts ex‐\\nplained in this chapter are foundational to the rest of the book.\\nIf you’re already familiar with these parts of Rust, feel free to skip ahead. However,\\nbefore you continue to the next chapters, make sure you have a good understanding of\\nthreads, interior mutability, Send and Sync, and know what a mutex, a condition\\nvariable, and thread parking are.\\nThreads in Rust\\nEvery program starts with exactly one thread: the main thread. This thread will execute\\nyour main  function and can be used to spawn more threads if necessary .\\nIn Rust, new threads are spawned using the std::thread:: spawn  function from the\\nstandard library . It takes a single argument: the function the new thread will execute. The\\nthread stops once this function returns.\\nLet’s take a look at an example:\\nuse std::thread;\\nfn main() {\\n    thread::spawn(f);\\n    thread::spawn(f);', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='    println!(\"Hello from the main thread.\");\\n}\\nfn f() {\\n    println!(\"Hello from another thread!\");\\n    let id = thread::current().id();\\n    println!(\"This is my thread id: {id:?}\");\\n}\\nWe spawn two threads that will both execute f as their main function. Both of these\\nthreads will print a message and show their thread id, while the main thread will also print\\nits own message.\\nThread ID\\nThe Rust standard library assigns every thread a unique identiﬁer . This iden‐\\ntiﬁer is accessible through Thread:: id()  and is of the type ThreadId .\\nThere’ s not much you can do with a ThreadId  other than copyin g it around\\nand checking for equality . There is no guarantee that these IDs will be as‐\\nsigned consecutively , only that they will be dif ferent for each thread.\\nIf you run our exam ple program above several times, you might notice the output varies be‐\\ntween runs. This is the output I got on my machine during one particular run :\\nHello from the main thread.\\nHello from another thread!\\nThis is my thread id:\\nSurprisingly , part of the output seems to be missing.\\nWhat happened here is that the main thread ﬁnished executing the main  function before\\nthe newly spawned threads ﬁnished executing their functions.\\nReturning from main  will exit the entire program, even if other threads are still running.\\nIn this particular example, one of the newly spawned threads had just enough time to get to\\nhalfway through the second message, before the program was shut down by the main\\nthread.\\nIf we want to make  sure the threads  are ﬁnished before we return from main , we can wait\\nfor them by joining  them. To do so, we have to use the JoinHandle  returned by the\\nspawn  function:\\nfn main() {\\n    let t1 = thread::spawn(f);\\n    let t2 = thread::spawn(f);', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='    println!(\"Hello from the main thread.\");\\n    t1.join().unwrap();\\n    t2.join().unwrap();\\n}\\nThe .join()  method waits until the thread has ﬁnished executing and returns a std::\\nthread:: Result . If the thread did not successfully ﬁnish its function because it panicked,\\nthis will contain the panic message. We could attempt to handle that situation, or just call\\n.unwrap()  to panic when joining a panicked thread.\\nRunning this version of our program will no longer result in truncated output:\\nHello from the main thread.\\nHello from another thread!\\nThis is my thread id: ThreadId(3)\\nHello from another thread!\\nThis is my thread id: ThreadId(2)\\nThe only thing that still changes between runs is the order in which the messages are\\nprinted :\\nHello from the main thread.\\nHello from another thread!\\nHello from another thread!\\nThis is my thread id: ThreadId(2)\\nThis is my thread id: ThreadId(3)\\nOutput Locking\\nThe println  macro uses std::io::Stdout:: lock()  to make sure its\\noutput does not get interrupted. A println!()  expression will wait until any\\nconcurrently runni ng one is ﬁnished before writing any output. If this was not\\nthe case, we could’ve gotten more interleaved output such as:\\nHello fromHello from another thread!\\n another This is my threthreadHello fromthread id: ThreadId!\\n( the main thread.\\n2)This is my thread\\nid: ThreadId(3)\\nRather than passing the name of a function to std::thread:: spawn , as in our example\\nabove, it’s far more common to pass it a closure .

If we had not used the move  keyword, the closure would have captured\\nnumbers  by refere nce. This would have resulted in a compiler error, since the new thread\\nmight outlive that variable.\\nSince a thread might run until the very end of the program’ s execution, the spawn  function\\nhas a \\'static  lifetime bound on its argument type. In other words, it only accepts func‐\\ntions that may be kept around forever . A closure capturing a local variable by reference\\nmay not be kept around forever , since that reference would become invalid the moment the\\nlocal variable ceases to exist.\\nGetting a value back out of the thread is done by returning it from the closure. This return\\nvalue can be obtained from the Result  returned by the join  method:\\nlet numbers = Vec::from_iter(0..=1000);\\nlet t = thread::spawn(move || {\\n    let len = numbers.len();\\n    let sum = numbers.iter().sum::<usize>();\\n    sum / len  1\\n});\\nlet average = t.join().unwrap(); 2\\nprintln!(\"average: {average}\");\\nHere, the value returned by the thread’ s closure (1) is sent back to the main thread\\nthrough the join  method ( 2).\\nIf numbers  had been empty , the thread would’ve panicked while trying to divide by zero (1\\n), and join  would’ve  returned  that panic message instead, causing the main thread to\\npanic too because of unwrap  (2).\\nThread Builder\\nThe std::thread:: spawn  function is actually just a convenient shorthand\\nfor std::thread:: Builder:: new().spawn().unwrap() .\\nA std::thread:: Builder  allows you to set some settings for the new\\nthread before spawning it. You can use it to conﬁgure the stack size for the', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1.

The name of a thread is\\navailable through std::thread:: current().name() , will be used in\\npanic messages, and will be visible in monitoring and debugging tools on\\nmost platforms.\\nAdditionally , Builder \\'s spawn  function returns an std::io::Result , al‐\\nlowing you to handle situations where spawning a new thread fails. This\\nmight happen if the operating system  runs out of memory , or if resource limits\\nhave been applied to your program. The std::thread:: spawn  function\\nsimply panics if it is unable to spawn a new thread.\\nScoped Threads\\nIf we know for sure that a spawned thread will deﬁnitely not outlive a certain scope, that\\nthread could safely borrow things that do not live forever , such as local variables, as long\\nas they outlive that scope.\\nThe Rust standard library provides the std::thread:: scope  function to spaw n such\\nscoped threads . It allows us to spawn threads that cannot outlive the scope of the closure\\nwe pass to that function, making it possible to safely borrow local variables.\\nHow it works is best shown with an example:\\nlet numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];\\nthread::scope(|s| { 1\\n    s.spawn(|| { 2\\n        println!(\"length: {}\", numbers.len());\\n    });\\n    s.spawn(|| { 2\\n        for n in &numbers {\\n            println!(\"{n}\");\\n        }\\n    });\\n}); 3\\n1We call the std::thread::scope function with a closure. Our closure is directly executed and\\ngets an argument, s, representing the scope.\\n2We use s to spawn threads. The closures can borrow local variables like numbers.\\n3When the scope ends, all threads that haven’t been joined yet are automatically joined.\\nThis patte rn guara ntees that none of the threads spawned in the scope can outlive the\\nscope. Because of that, this scoped spawn  method does not have a \\'static  bound on its\\nargument type, allowing us to refere nce anything as long as it outlives the scope, such as\\nnumbers .', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1.

Any borrowed\\ndata only needed to outlive this JoinGuard . This seemed safe, as long as\\nthe JoinGuard  got dropped at some point.\\nJust before the release of Rust 1.0, it slowly became clear that it’s not possi‐\\nble to guarantee that something will be dropped. There are many ways, such\\nas creating a cycle  of reference-counted nodes, that make it possible to for‐\\nget about something, or leak it, without dropping it.\\nEventually , in what some people refer to as \"The Leakpocalypse,\" the conclu ‐\\nsion was made that the design of a (safe) interface cannot rely on the as‐', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='sumption that objects will always be dropped at the end of their lifetime.\\nLeaking an object might reasonably result in leaking more objects (e.g., leak‐\\ning a Vec will also leak its elements), but it may not result in undeﬁned be‐\\nhavior . Because of this conclusion, std::thread:: scoped  was no longer\\ndeemed safe and was removed from the standard library . Additionally , std::\\nmem::forget  was upgraded from an unsafe  function to a safe function, to\\nemphasize that forgetting (or leaking) is always a possibility .\\nOnly much later, in Rust 1.63, a new std::thread:: scope  function was\\nadded with a new design that does not rely on Drop  for correctness.\\nShared Ownership and Reference Counting\\nSo far we’ve looked at transferring ownership of a value to a thread using a move  closure\\n(\"Threads in Rust\" ) and borrowing data from longe r-living parent threads (\"Scoped\\nThreads\" ). When sharing data between two threads where neither thread is guaranteed to\\noutlive the other , neither of them can be the owner of that data. Any data shared between\\nthem will need to live as long as the longest living thread.\\nStatics\\nThere are several ways to create something that’s not owned by a single thread. The sim‐\\nplest one is a static  value, which is \"owned\" by the entire program, instead of an individ ‐\\nual thread. In the following example , both threads can access X, but neith er of them owns\\nit:\\nstatic X: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];\\nthread::spawn(|| dbg!(&X));\\nthread::spawn(|| dbg!(&X));\\nA static  item has a consta nt initializer , is never dropped, and already exists before the\\nmain function of the program even starts. Every thread can borrow it, since it’s guaranteed\\nto always exist.\\nLeaking\\nAnother way to share ownership is by leaking  an alloca tion. Using Box::leak , one can re‐\\nlease ownership of a Box, promising to never drop it. From that point on, the Box will live\\nforever , without an owner , allowing it to be borrowed by any thread for as long as the pro‐\\ngram runs.\\nlet x: &\\'static [i32; 3] = Box::leak(Box::new([1, 2, 3]));', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='🌈thread::spawn(move || dbg!(x));\\nthread::spawn(move || dbg!(x));\\nThe move  closure might make it look like we’re moving ownership into the threads, but a\\ncloser look at the type of x reveals that we’re  only giving the threads a reference  to the\\ndata.\\nReferences are Copy, meaning that when you \"move\" them, the original still exists, just\\nlike with an integer or boolean.\\nNote how the \\'static  lifetime doesn’t mean that the value lived since the start of the pro‐\\ngram, but only that it lives to the end of the program. The past is simply not relevant.\\nThe downside of leaking a Box is that we’re leaking memory . We allocate something, but\\nnever drop and deallocate it. This can be ﬁne if it happens only a limited number of times.\\nBut if we keep doing this, the program will slowly run out of memory .\\nReference Counting\\nTo make sure that shared data gets dropped and deallocated, we can’t completely give up\\nits owner ship. Instead, we can share ownership . By keeping track of the number of owners,\\nwe can make sure the value is dropped only when there are no owners left.\\nThe Rust standard  library provides this functionality through the std::rc::Rc type, short\\nfor \"reference counted.\" It is very similar to a Box, except cloning it will not allocate any‐\\nthing new, but instead increment a counter stored next to the contained value. Both the\\noriginal and cloned Rc will refer to the same allocation; they share ownership .\\nuse std::rc::Rc;\\nlet a = Rc::new([1, 2, 3]);\\nlet b = a.clone();\\nassert_eq!(a.as_ptr(), b.as_ptr()); // Same allocation!\\nDropping an Rc will decrement the counter . Only the last Rc, which will see the counter\\ndrop to zero, will be the one dropping and deallocating the contained data.\\nIf we were to try to send an Rc to another thread,  however , we would run into the following\\ncompiler error:\\nerror[E0277]: `Rc` cannot be sent between threads safely\\n    |\\n8   |     thread::spawn(move || dbg!(b));\\n    |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAs it turns out, Rc is not thread safe (more on that in \"Thread Safety: Send and Sync\" ).

Both decrement\\nthe reference counter when they drop their Arc. The last thread to drop its Arc will see the\\ncounter drop to zero and will be the one to drop and deallocate the array.\\nNaming Clones\\nHaving to give every clone of an Arc a different name can quickly make the\\ncode quite cluttered and hard to follow . While every clone of an Arc is a sep‐\\narate object, each  clone represents the same shared value, which is not well\\nreﬂected by naming each one dif ferently .\\nRust allows (and encourages) you to shadow  variables by deﬁning a new\\nvariable with the same name. If you do that in the same scope, the original\\nvariable cannot be named anymore. But by opening a new scope, a state ‐\\nment like let a = a.clone();  can be used to reuse the same name with‐\\nin that scope, while leaving the original variable available outside the scope.\\nBy wrapping a closure in a new scope (with {}), we can clone variables be‐\\nfore moving them into the closure, without having to rename them.\\nlet a = Arc::new([1, 2, 3]);\\nlet b = a.clone();\\nthread::spawn(move || {\\n    dbg!(b);\\n});\\ndbg!(a);let a = Arc::new([1, 2, 3]);\\nthread::spawn({\\n    let a = a.clone();\\n    move || {\\n        dbg!(a);\\n    }\\n});', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1.

They do not give you mutable access to their\\ncontained value, since the value might be borrowed by other code at the same time .\\nFor exam ple, if we were to try to sort the slice of integers in an Arc<[i32]> , the compiler\\nwould stop us from doing so, telling us that we’re not allowed to mutate the data :\\nerror[E0596]: cannot borrow data in an `Arc` as mutable\\n  |\\n6 |     a.sort();\\n  |     ^^^^^^^^\\nBorrowing and Data Races\\nIn Rust, values can be borrowed in two ways:\\nImmutable borrowing\\nBorrowing someth ing with & gives an immutable referen ce. Such a reference can be\\ncopied. Access to the data it referen ces is shared between all copies of such a refer‐\\nence. As the name implies, the compiler doesn’t normally allow you to mutate  some ‐\\nthing through such a reference, since that might affect other code that’s currently bor‐\\nrowing the same data.\\nMutable borrowing\\nBorrowing someth ing with &mut  gives a mutable reference . A mutable borrow guar‐\\nantees it’s the only active borrow of that data. This ensures that mutating the data will\\nnot change anything that other code is currently looking at.\\nThese two concepts together fully prevent data races: situations where one thread is mu‐\\ntating data while another is concurrently accessing it. Data races are generally undeﬁned\\nbehavior , which means the compiler does not need to take these situations into account. It\\nwill simply assume they do not happen.\\nTo clarify what that means, let’s take a look at an example where the compiler can make a\\nuseful assumption using the borrowing rules:\\nfn f(a: &i32, b: &mut i32) {\\n    let before = *a;\\n    *b += 1;', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='    let after = *a;\\n    if before != after {\\n        x(); // never happens\\n    }\\n}\\nHere, we get an immutable reference to an integer , and store the value of the integer both\\nbefore and after incrementing the integer that b refers to. The compiler is free to assume\\nthat the fundamental rules about borrowing and data races are upheld, which means that b\\ncan’t possibly refer to the same integer as a does. In fact, nothing in the entire program can\\nmutably borrow the integer that a refers to as long as a is borrowing it. Therefore, the com‐\\npiler can easily conclude that *a will not change and the condition of the if statement will\\nnever be true, and can completely remove the call to x from the progra m as an\\noptimization.\\nIt’s impos sible to write a Rust program that breaks the compiler ’s assumptions, other than\\nby using an unsafe  block to disable some of the compiler ’s safety checks.\\nUndeﬁned Behavior\\nLanguages like C, C++, and Rust have a set of rules that need to be followed\\nto avoid something called undeﬁned behavior . For example, one of Rust’ s\\nrules is that there  may never be more than one mutable reference to any\\nobject.\\nIn Rust, it’s only possible to break any of these rules when using unsafe\\ncode. \"Unsafe\" doesn’t mean that the code  is incorrect or never safe to use,\\nbut rathe r that the compiler is not validating for you that the code is safe. If\\nthe code does violate these rules, it is called unsound .\\nThe compiler is allowed to assume, without checking, that these rules are\\nnever broken. When broken, this results in something called undeﬁned be‐\\nhavior , which we need to avoid at all costs. If we allow the compiler to make\\nan assumption that is not actually true, it can easily result in more wrong con‐\\nclusions about dif ferent parts of your code, af fecting your whole program.\\nAs a concrete example, let’s take a look at a small snippet that uses the\\nget_unchecked  method on a slice:\\nlet a = [123, 456, 789];\\nlet b = unsafe { a.get_unchecked(index) };\\nThe get_unchecked  method gives us an element of the slice given its in‐\\ndex, just like a[index] , but allows the compiler to assume the index is al‐\\nways within bounds, without any checks.', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='This means that in this code snippet, because a is of length 3, the compiler\\nmay assume that index  is less than three. It’s up to us to make sure its as‐\\nsumption holds.\\nIf we break this assumption, for example if we run this with index  equal to 3,\\nanything might happen.

It can cause\\nall kinds of havoc.\\nPerhaps surprisingly , undeﬁned behavior can even \"travel back in time,\"\\ncausing problems in code that precedes it. To understand how that can hap‐\\npen, imagine we had a match  stateme nt before our previous snippet, as\\nfollows:\\nmatch index {\\n   0 => x(),\\n   1 => y(),\\n   _ => z(index),\\n}\\nlet a = [123, 456, 789];\\nlet b = unsafe { a.get_unchecked(index) };\\nBecause of the unsafe code, the compiler is allowed to assume index  is\\nonly ever 0, 1, or 2. It may logically conclude that the last arm of our match\\nstatement will only ever match a 2, and thus that z is only ever called as\\nz(2) . That conclusion might be used not only to optimize the match , but\\nalso to optimize z itself. This can include throwing out unused parts of the\\ncode.\\nIf we execute this with an index  of 3, our program might attempt to exec ute\\nparts that have been optimized away , resulting in completely unpredic table\\nbehavior , long before we get to the unsafe  block on the last line. Just like\\nthat, undeﬁned behavior can propag ate through a whole program, both back ‐\\nwards and forwards, in often very unexpected ways.\\nWhen calling any unsafe  function, read its documentation carefully and\\nmake sure you fully understand its safety requirements : the assumptions you\\nneed to uphold, as the caller , to avoid undeﬁned behavior .\\nInterior Mutability\\nThe borrowing rules as introduced in the previous section are simple, but can be quite limit‐\\ning—especially when multiple threads are involved.

It does not change anything about exclusive borrowing.\\nExclusive borrowing still guarantees that there are no other active borrows. Unsafe code\\nthat results in more than one active exclusive reference to something always invokes\\nundeﬁned behavior, regardless of interior mutability.\\nLet’s take a look at a few types with interior mutability and how they can allow mutation\\nthrough shared references without causing undeﬁned behavior .\\nCell\\nA std::cell::Cell<T>  simply wraps a T, but allow s mutati ons through a shared refer‐\\nence. To avoid undeﬁned behavior , it only allows you to copy the value out (if T is Copy ), or\\nreplace it with another value as a whole. In addition, it can only be used within a single\\nthread.\\nLet’s take a look at an example similar to the one in the previous sectio n, but this time us‐\\ning Cell<i32>  instead of i32:\\nuse std::cell::Cell;\\nfn f(a: &Cell<i32>, b: &Cell<i32>) {\\n    let before = a.get();\\n    b.set(b.get() + 1);\\n    let after = a.get();\\n    if before != after {\\n        x(); // might happen\\n    }\\n}', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1.

Both a and b might refer to the same value, such  that\\nmutating through b might affect a as well. It may still assume, however , that no other\\nthreads are accessing the cells concurrently .\\nThe restrictions on a Cell  are not always easy to work with. Since it can’t directly let us\\nborrow the value it holds, we need to move a value out (leaving something in its place),\\nmodify it, then put it back, to mutate its contents:\\nfn f(v: &Cell<Vec<i32>>) {\\n    let mut v2 = v.take(); // Replaces the contents of the Cell with an empty Vec\\n    v2.push(1);\\n    v.set(v2); // Put the modified Vec back\\n}\\nRefCell\\nUnlike a regular Cell , a std::cell::RefCell  does allow you to borrow its contents, at\\na small runtime cost. A RefCell<T>  does not only hold a T, but also holds a counter that\\nkeeps track of any outstanding borrows. If you try to borrow it while it is already mutably\\nborrowed (or vice-versa), it will panic , which avoids undeﬁned behavior . Just like a Cell , a\\nRefCell  can only be used within a single thread.\\nBorrowing the contents of RefCell  is done by calling borrow  or borrow_mut:\\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\\nfn f(v: &RefCell<Vec<i32>>) {\\n    v.borrow_mut().push(1); // We can modify the `Vec` directly.\\n}\\nWhile Cell  and RefCell  can be very usefu l, they become rather useless when we need\\nto do something with multiple threads. So let’s move on to the types that are relevant for\\nconcurrency .\\nMutex and RwLock\\nAn RwLock  or reader-writer lock is the concurrent version of a RefCell . An RwLock<T>\\nholds a T and tracks any outstanding borrow s. However , unlike a RefCell , it does not\\npanic on conﬂicting borrows. Instead, it blocks the current thread— putting it to sleep— while\\nwaiting for conﬂicti ng borrows to disappear . We’ll just have to patiently wait for our turn with\\nthe data, after the other threads are done with it.\\nBorrowing the contents of an RwLock  is called locking . By locking  it we temporarily block\\nconcurrent conﬂicting borrows, allowing us to borrow it without causing data races.', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1.

Instead of keeping track of the\\nnumber of shared and exclusive borrows like an RwLock , it only allows exclusive borrows.\\nWe’ll go more into detail on these types in \"Locking: Mutexes and RwLocks\" .\\nAtomics\\nThe atomic types represent the concurrent version of a Cell , and are the main topic of\\nChapters 2 and 3. Like a Cell , they avoid undeﬁned behavior by making us copy values in\\nand out as a whole, without letting us borrow the contents directly .\\nUnlike a Cell , though, they cannot be of arbitrary size. Because of this, there is no generic\\nAtomic<T>  type for any T, but there are only speciﬁc atomic types such as AtomicU32\\nand AtomicPtr<T> . Which ones are available depends on the platform, since they require\\nsupport from the processor to avoid data races. (W e’ll dive into that in Chapter\\xa07 .)\\nSince they are so limited in size, atomics often don’t directly contain the information that\\nneeds to be shared between threads . Instead, they are often used as a tool to make it pos‐\\nsible to share other— often bigger— things between threads. When atomics are used to say\\nsomething about other data, things can get surprisingly complicated.\\nUnsafeCell\\nAn UnsafeCell  is the primitive building block for interior mutability .\\nAn UnsafeCell<T>  wraps a T, but does not come with any conditions or restrictions to\\navoid undeﬁned behavior . Instead, its get()  method just gives  a raw pointer to the value it\\nwraps, which can only be meaningfully used in unsafe  blocks. It leaves it up to the user to\\nuse it in a way that does not cause any undeﬁned behavior .\\nMost commonly , an UnsafeCell  is not used directl y, but wrapped in another type that pro‐\\nvides safety through a limited interfa ce, such as Cell  or Mutex . All types with interior mu‐\\ntability— including all types discussed above— are built on top of UnsafeCell .\\nThread Safety: Send and Sync\\nIn this chapter , we’ve seen several types that are not thread safe, types that can only be\\nused on a single thread, such as Rc, Cell , and others. Since that restriction is needed to\\navoid undeﬁned behavior , it’s something the compiler needs to underst and and check for\\nyou, so you can use these types without having to use unsafe  blocks.\\nThe language uses two special traits to keep track of which types can be safely used\\nacross threads:\\nSend', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1.

If other\\nthreads are waiting to lock the mutex, unlocking will cause one of those threads to be wok‐\\nen up, so it can try to lock the mutex again and continue its course.\\nProtecting data with a mutex is simply the agreement between all threads that they will only\\naccess the data when they have the mutex locked. That way, no two threads can ever ac‐\\ncess that data concurrently and cause a data race.\\nRust’s Mutex\\nThe Rust standard library provides this functionality through std::sync::Mutex<T> . It is\\ngeneric over a type T, which is the type of the data the mutex is protecting. By making this\\nT part of the mutex, the data can only be accessed through the mutex, allowing for a safe\\ninterface that can guarantee all threads will uphold the agreement.\\nTo ensure  a locked mutex can only be unlocked by the thread that locked it, it does not\\nhave an unlock()  method. Instead, its lock()  method returns a special type called a\\nMutexGuard . This guard represents the guarant ee that we have locked the mutex. It be‐\\nhaves like an exclusive reference through the DerefMut  trait, giving us exclusive access\\nto the data the mutex protects. Unlocking the mutex is done by dropping the guard. When\\nwe drop the guard, we give up our ability to access the data, and the Drop  implementation\\nof the guard will unlock the mutex.\\nLet’s take a look at an example to see a mutex in practice:\\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\\nfn main() {\\n    let n = Mutex::new(0);\\n    thread::scope(|s| {\\n        for _ in 0..10 {\\n            s.spawn(|| {\\n                let mut guard = n.lock().unwrap();\\n                for _ in 0..100 {\\n                    *guard += 1;\\n                }\\n            });\\n        }\\n    });\\n    assert_eq!(n.into_inner().unwrap(), 1000);\\n}\\nHere, we have a Mutex<i32> , a mutex protectin g an integer , and we spawn ten threads to\\neach increment the integer one hundred times.

In our example above, if a thread would panic after incrementing the in‐\\nteger fewer than 100 times, the mutex would unlock and the integer would be left in an un‐\\nexpected state where it is no longer a multiple of 100, possibly breaking assumptions made\\nby other threads. Automatically marking the mutex as poisoned in that case forces the user\\nto handle this possibility .\\nCalling lock()  on a poisoned mutex still locks the mutex. The Err returned by lock()\\ncontains the MutexGuard , allowing us to correct an inconsistent state if necessary .\\nWhile lock poisoni ng might seem like a powerful mechanism, recovering from a potentially\\ninconsistent state is not often done in practice. Most code either disregards poison or uses\\nunwrap()  to panic if the lock was poisoned, effectively propagating panics to all users of\\nthe mutex.\\nLifetime of the MutexGuard\\nWhile it’s convenie nt that implicitly dropping a guard unlocks the mutex, it can\\nsometimes lead to subtle surprises. If we assign the guard a name with a\\nlet statement (as in our examples above), it’s relatively straightforward to\\nsee when it will be dropped, since local variables are dropped at the end of\\nthe scope they are deﬁned in. Still, not explicitly dropping a guard might  lead\\nto keeping the mutex locked for longer than necessary , as demonstrate d in\\nthe examples above.\\nUsing a guard without  assigning it a name is also possible, and can be very\\nconvenient at times.

It has three\\nstates: unlocked, locked by a single writer  (for exclusive access), and locked by any num‐\\nber of readers  (for shared access). It is commonly used for data that is often read by multi‐\\nple threads, but only updated once in a while.\\nThe Rust standard  library provides this lock through the std::sync::RwLock<T>  type. It\\nworks similarly to the standard Mutex , except its interface is mostly split in two parts.\\nInstead of a single lock()  method, it has a read()  and write()  method for lockin g as\\neither a reader or a writer . It comes with two guard types, one for reader s and one for writ‐\\ners: RwLockReadGuard  and RwLockWriteGuard . The former only implements Deref  to\\nbehave like a shared reference to the protected data, while the latter also implements\\nDerefMut  to behave like an exclusive reference.\\nIt is effectively the multi-threaded version of RefCell , dynamically tracking the number of\\nreferences to ensure the borrow rules are upheld.\\nBoth Mutex<T>  and RwLock<T>  require T to be Send , because they can be used to send\\na T to another thread . An RwLock<T>  additionally requires T to also implemen t Sync , be‐\\ncause it allows multiple threads to hold a shared reference (&T) to the protected data.\\n(Strictly speaking, you can create a lock for a T that doesn’t fulﬁll these requiremen ts, but\\nyou wouldn’t be able to share it between threads as the lock itself won’t implement Sync .)\\nThe Rust standard  library provides only one general purpose RwLock  type, but its imple ‐\\nmentation depends on the operating system. There are many subtle variations between\\nreader-writer lock implementations.  Most implementations will block new readers when\\nthere is a writer waiting, even when the lock is already read-locked. This is done to prevent\\nwriter starvation , a situati on where  many readers collectively keep the lock from ever un‐\\nlocking, never allowing any writer to update the data.\\nMutexes in Other Languages\\nRust’ s standard Mutex  and RwLock  types look a bit different than those you\\nﬁnd in other languages like C or C++.', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1.

When the queue is empty , it stops and goes to sleep using\\nthe park()  function.  If it gets unparked, the park()  call returns, and the loop  continues,\\npopping items from the queue again until it is empty . And so on.\\nThe producing thread produces a new number every second by pushing it into the queue.\\nEvery time it adds an item, it uses the unpark()  method on the Thread  object that refers\\nto the consuming thread to unpark it. That way, the consuming thread  gets woken up to\\nprocess the new element.\\nAn impor tant obse rvation to make here is that this program would still be theoretically cor‐\\nrect, altho ugh inefﬁcient, if we remo ve parking. This is important, beca use park()  does\\nnot guara ntee that it will only return because of a matching unpark() . While somewhat\\nrare, it might have spurious wake-ups . Our example deals with that just ﬁne, because the\\nconsuming thread will lock the queue, see that it is empty , and directly unlock it and park it‐\\nself again.\\nAn important property of thread parking is that a call to unpark()  before  the threa d parks\\nitself does not get lost. The request to unpark is still recorded, and the next time the thread\\ntries to park itself, it clears that request and directly continues without actually going to\\nsleep. To see why that is critical for correct operation, let’s go through a possible ordering\\nof the steps executed by both threads:\\n1. The consuming thread—let’ s call it C—locks the queue.\\n2. C tries to pop an item from the queue, but it is empty , resulting in None .', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content='3. C unlocks the queue.\\n4. The producing thread, which we’ll call P , locks the queue.\\n5. P pushes a new item onto the queue.\\n6. P unlocks the queue again.\\n7. P calls unpark()  to notify C that there are new items.\\n8. C calls park()  to go to sleep, to wait for more items.\\nWhile there is most likely only a very brief moment between releasing the queue in step 3\\nand parking in step 8, steps 4 through 7 could potentially happen in that moment before the\\nthread parks itself. If unpark()  would do nothing if the thread wasn’t parked, the notif‐\\nication would be lost. The consuming thread would still be waiting, even if there were an\\nitem in the queue. Thanks to unpark requests getting saved for a future call to park() , we\\ndon’t have to worry about this.\\nHowever , unpark requests don’t stack up. Calling unpark()  two times and then calling\\npark()  two times afterwards still results in the thread going to sleep. The ﬁrst park()\\nclears the request and returns directly , but the second one goes to sleep as usual.\\nThis means that in our example above it’s important that we only park the thread if we’ve\\nseen the queue is empty , rather than park it after every processed item. While it’s extreme ‐\\nly unlikely to happen in this example because of the huge (one second) sleep, it’s possible\\nfor multiple unpark()  calls to wake up only a single park()  call.\\nUnfortunately , this does mean that if unpark()  is called right after park()  returns, but be‐\\nfore the queue gets locked and emptied out, the unpark()  call was unneces sary but still\\ncauses the next park()  call to instantly return. This results in the (empty) queue getting\\nlocked and unlock ed an extra time. While this doesn’t affect the corre ctness of the pro‐\\ngram, it does af fect its efﬁciency and performance.\\nThis mechanism works well for simple situations like in our example, but quickly breaks\\ndown when things get more complicated. For example, if we had multiple consumer\\nthreads taking items from the same queue, the producer thread would have no way of\\nknowing which of the consumers is actually waiting and should be woken up. The producer\\nwill have to know exactly when a consumer is waiting, and what condition it is waiting for .\\nCondition Variables\\nCondition variable s are a more commonly used option for waiting for something to happen\\nto data protected by a mutex. They have two basic operations: wait and notify . Threads can\\nwait on a condition variable, after which they can be woken up when another thread notiﬁes\\nthat same  conditio n variable. Multiple threads can wait on the same condition variable, and\\nnotiﬁcations can either be sent to one waiting thread, or to all of them.', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content='This means that we can create a condition variable for speciﬁc events or conditions we’re\\ninterested in, such as the queue being non-empty , and wait on that condition. Any thread\\nthat caus es that event or condition to happen then notiﬁes the conditio n variable, without\\nhaving to know which or how many threads are interested in that notiﬁcation.\\nTo avoid the issue  of missing notiﬁc ations in the brief moment between unlocking a mutex\\nand waiting for a condition variable, condition variables provide a way to atomically  unlock\\nthe mutex and start waiting. This means there is simply no possible moment for notiﬁca ‐\\ntions to get lost.\\nThe Rust standard library provides  a condition variable as std::sync::Condvar . Its\\nwait  method takes a MutexGuard  that proves we’ve  locked the mutex . It ﬁrst unlocks the\\nmutex and goes to sleep. Later , when woken up, it relocks the mutex and returns a new\\nMutexGuard  (which proves that the mutex is locked again).\\nIt has two notify functions: notify_one to wake up just one waiting thread (if any), and\\nnotify_all to wake them all up.\\nLet’s modify the example we used for thread parking to use Condvar  instead:\\nuse std::sync::Condvar;\\nlet queue = Mutex::new(VecDeque::new());\\nlet not_empty = Condvar::new();\\nthread::scope(|s| {\\n    s.spawn(|| {\\n        loop {\\n            let mut q = queue.lock().unwrap();\\n            let item = loop {\\n                if let Some(item) = q.pop_front() {\\n                    break item;\\n                } else {\\n                    q = not_empty.wait(q).unwrap();\\n                }\\n            };\\n            drop(q);\\n            dbg!(item);\\n        }\\n    });\\n    for i in 0.. {\\n        queue.lock().unwrap().push_back(i);\\n        not_empty.notify_one();\\n        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));\\n    }\\n});\\nWe had to change a few things:\\nWe now not only have a Mutex  containing the queue, but also a Condvar  to\\ncommunicate the \"not empty\" condition.', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Rust Atomics and Locks — Chapter 1. Basics of Rust Concurrency.pdf', 'page': 25}), Document(page_content='We no longer need to know which thread to wake up, so we don’t store the return\\nvalue from spawn  anymore. Instead, we notify the consumer through the condition\\nvariable with the notify_one method.\\nUnlocking, waiting, and relocking is all done by the wait  method. W e had to\\nrestructure the control ﬂow a bit to be able to pass the guard to the wait  method,\\nwhile still dropping it before processing an item.\\nNow we can spaw n as many consu ming threads as we like, and even spawn more later,\\nwithout having to change anything. The condition variable takes care of delivering the noti‐\\nﬁcations to whichever thread is interested.\\nIf we had a more complicated system with threads that are interested in different condi ‐\\ntions, we could deﬁne a Condvar  for each condition . For example, we could deﬁne one to\\nindicate the queue is non-empty and another one to indicate it is empty .
