> ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Please bear ðŸ§¸ with me! If you can't wait please try [read more](../../bye.md).

![](/assets/kat.png) <span class="speech-bubble">At this point you will notice that you code is growing and need to be separate them as a library.
We will do just that in this `R3`! and also some idiom/pattern/crate you need to know before become crate master.</span>
